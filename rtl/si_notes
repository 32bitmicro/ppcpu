allow using internal flash in place of rom (config via external pin) qspi passthrough programming mode
access auxilary caravel sram as internal memory
few gpio pins by sreg???
it says it can be accessed via wishbone so why not?
none of that could be used.....
so best we can do is small internal memory that can be programmed from that internal mgmt core
